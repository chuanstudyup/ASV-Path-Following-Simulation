# ASV-Path-Following-Simulation
A path following simulation for autonomous surface vehicle on Matlab/Simulink.

It can run on Matlab 2020b and newer versions. Matlab must be installed Simulink 3D Animation toolbox.

AUV model using Remus100 in 《Verification of a six-degree of freedom simulation model for the REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle》.

The path following method in the platform is line-of-sight guidance law and PID heading autopilot 《Line-of-Sight Path Following for Dubins Paths With Adaptive Sideslip Compensation of Drift Forces》.
